Slay-Makefile

Slay::Maker is a make engine that uses perl declaration syntax for
rules, including regular expressions for targets and anonymous subs
for targets, dependencies, and actions.  The SlayMakefile wrapper
allows for the rules to be contained within a SlayMakefile file whose
syntax is similar to that of a normal Makefile.
